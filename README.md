---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes 
- Understand and apply NLP preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.

## 📖 Brief Theory

### 🔹 Natural Language Processing (NLP)

NLP enables machines to understand and interpret human language. It involves:
- **Tokenization** – Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
- **Stopword Removal** – Removing common words that don’t contribute much meaning.
- **Stemming** – Converting words to their root forms.
- **Lemmatization** – More accurate root word extraction using grammar rules.

### 🔹 Vectorization Techniques

- **CountVectorizer**: Converts text into a matrix of token counts.
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer**: Weighs tokens based on frequency and importance across documents.

### 🔹 Classification Algorithms

- **Logistic Regression**: A linear model effective for binary/multiclass classification.
- **Naive Bayes (Multinomial)**: A probabilistic classifier well-suited for text data.
